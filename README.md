# Guess-the-Number-Game

"Guess the Number Game" is a simple game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number within a given range. The game prompts the player to enter their guesses and provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low. The player has a limited number of guesses before the game ends, and if they correctly guess the number within that limit, they win. Otherwise, they lose. The game can be customized with additional features such as a timer or a difficulty level. It is a fun and engaging way to test the player's intuition and numerical skills.
